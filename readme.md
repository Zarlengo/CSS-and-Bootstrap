### Attendance Website

A website designed to check in students at a martial arts studio. The point of sale system was not designed for recurring attendance of its members on a frequent basis and required manually typing in the clients name at the office computer to register a student into class.

This system replaces the laborious system with a simple quick solution to check in clients into a class. A single button click will perform the API call necessary to integrate into the mindbodyonline.com system and enter the client into the schedule.

This is linked to a test database which resets nightly, so there are no issues with clicking buttons and exploring the interface.

### Operation Board

One of many programs developed for Flow International, Corp. to utilize in the production environment. This system displays information retained within a SQL database to provide current production status of each machine fixture that is currently in operation.

Columns represent a single fixture on a machine, the green and red squares represent a single piece that was processed on that fixture. Green boxes are parts that have passed inspection and are ready to ship, while red boxes are parts that have failed the CMM inspection.

Additionally within the summary snapshot area, wear items with their current hours are displayed with red being ones that need to be monitored and replaced shortly. The current production metrics for the week are shown, identifying if production and shipping are ahead or behind schedule.

### Sodoku Animation

An animation of a python script which solves sodoku problems. Created initially to solve [Project Euler Problem #96](https://projecteuler.net/problem=96). The methodology that the script uses to determine the solution is what is animated for the viewer. The initial 50 problems from the problem are selectable along with a link to a database containing around 1,000,000 additional problem sets provided from Kyubyong Park on Kaggle.com.

### Space Invaders Game

A space invaders inspired game. There are power-ups that fall through out the game boosting level capabilities along with some cheat modes that can be enabled in the beginning of the game. These codes are the same commands as from the original version.

### Minimum Path Animation

Another animation of a python script which determines the least cost path between two points in the system. Box sizing is adjustable through the sliders and the numbers are randomly generated. Inspired from [Project Euler Problem #83](https://projecteuler.net/problem=83).
